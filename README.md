# Retrospect
This was a nice simple introduction project after learning the basics of Spring Boot and how to have it interact with various things like HTML, Thymeleafe, JDBC and SQL.
Now it is time to move on to learning Spring Security and creating another web app that builds on what I learned from this and utilizes all of the above and Spring Security.
